1,"Abomasal displacement is the most important disease associated with the abomasum in cattle, although risks to pasture-fed cattle are likely to be less than those in intensive concentrate-based systems.

5,"All cases where the pregnancy terminates early and the fetus is expelled are called abortions. Abortion may be defined as the loss of a fetus between day 42 and 271 of pregnancy, with fetal loss before this stage defined as early embryonic death (before day 14) and late embryonic death (between days 14 and 42). There are multiple potential causes of abortion and the detection of abortions in a herd can vary significantly depending on the husbandry system and calving pattern. Therefore, the reported incidence of abortion at herd level also varies markedly. It has been suggested that an abortion rate of 5% or more in a herd should be considered an indication of an abortion problem (Deas, 1981).","The causes of abortion have been classified by Boyd and Gray (1992) as follows:

Infectious:
Non-specific
Specific
Miscellaneous:
Drug-induced (prostaglandin )
Insemination/intra-uterine infusion
Trauma/stress (transport, noise, veterinary treatment etc.)
High fever and endotoxins (toxic plants, nitrate/nitrite, fungal toxins, other disease)
Nutritional (malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, selenium/vitamin E deficiency, goiter)
Twin pregnancy
Genetic (malformation)
Hypothyroidism","Includes the following conditions: Listerial Encephalitis, Epizootic Abortion, Fungal Abortion, Mycotic Abortion, Trichomoniasis","As it is virtually impossible to prevent an abortion from happening once the expulsion of a fetus has begun, the treatment should concentrate on making sure that the dam does not suffer any long-term effects from the event. Subsequent retained fetal membranes or metritis need to be attended to.

In the case of an unknown cause, further spread of a potential contagious infection should be prevented by isolating the affected cow/cows, until discharges have cleared and/or until advised by a veterinary surgeon.","To prevent abortions from happening or abortive agents from entering the herd, the following points should be included in the Herd Health Plan:

Establish a closed herd policy where possible
If buying in stock, obtain from an accredited health status herd
Screen and isolate bought-in animals for abortive agents such as IBR, BVD, Leptospirosis and potentially neosporosis
Establish good biosecurity on the farm
Establish a good recording system for abortions on the farm (date, cow, stage of gestation, additional information, results of systemic examination by a vet)
Undertake a disease investigation if the annual incidence is more than 4% (4 cows in 100) or if several abortions occur in a short period of time
Isolate animals which have aborted and dispose safely of the fetus and placenta
Avoid dog access to the fetus and placenta (See Neospora caninum)","An important cornerstone of abortion control in a cattle herd is good record-keeping of abortion events, and identification, if possible, of the causes in each detected case of abortion. It is good practice to investigate all abortions, even though less than 10% of all laboratory investigations of abortions produce a conclusive result (VIDA, 2012). Over a period of time, a picture of the herd’s health status will emerge, and can be used to refine the Herd Health Plan to control disease.",abortion,5
6,"Primary ketosis, or acetonemia, is a metabolic disorder and is largely a disease that is influenced by management of dairy cows in early lactation. Ketosis is an important clinical and subclinical disease, as there are several metabolic disorders and diseases that commonly occur in the calving and the early lactation period  that are linked to ketosis (including milk fever, retained foetal membranes and displaced abomasum). Hypoglycemia is the major factor involved in the onset and development of clinical ketosis. There is a gradual loss of body condition over several days or even weeks. There is also a moderate to marked decline in milk yield (up to 5 liters per day) over five to six days before the onset of obvious clinical signs (Edwards and Tozer, 2004). This can persist for up to two weeks after diagnosis (Rajala-Schultz et al., 1999). The disease is most commonly seen in high-yielding dairy cows in early lactation. Secondary ketosis due to lack of appetite as a result of another disease can be seen at any stage of lactation. Beef cows may also suffer from ketosis during pregnancy, although this is less commonly recognized.","The season, ketosis is more likely in winter

Beef cows may also suffer from ketosis during pregnancy, although this is less commonly recognized.","Diagnosis is confirmed by the clinical signs of milk drop, reduced appetite and elevated ketones in the blood, urine or milk.

There are three main aims of treatment:

To restore blood glucose levels as quickly as possible
To replenish oxaloacetate, the essential intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), so that fatty acids are completely oxidized and the production of ketone bodies reduced
To increase the availability of dietary glycogenic precursors, notably propionic acid (Eddy, 2004)
Intravenous glucose therapy with 500 ml 40% glucose will give a short term rise in blood glucose levels that will only last 2 hours. It should be accompanied by oral administration of a glucose precursor, preferably propylene glycol. Administer propylene glycol twice daily for three to four days. Cobalt salts may be added to propylene glycol.","The following points should be considered:

Cows should not be too fat at calving, as this depresses their feed intakes. A condition score of 2.5-3.0 on a 1-5 scale is optimal, and anything higher is considered too fat and at greater risk of ketosis (Gillund et al., 2001; Melendez et al., 2004)
Concentrates fed during lactation should be introduced in small amounts, approximately two weeks before calving, to allow adjustments of the rumen microflora. Dietary changes during early lactation should be made gradually
Efforts should be made to ease the transition from gestation to lactation by offering highly palatable forage at calving and providing suitable accommodation and assistance where necessary (Grummer et al., 2004; Moorby et al., 2002)
Roughage high in butyric acid should be avoided in early lactation. Forage quality should be checked several times every year. In cobalt deficient areas, measures should be taken to ensure adequate cobalt intake (Eddy, 2004)
A sufficient supply of high quality forage is essential for beef cows in late pregnancy
Metabolic profiles using blood samples taken from groups of dry cows and cows in early lactation can help vets monitor the herd health and detect subclinical disease. Dietary changes can then be made if necessary to reduce disease. Milk tests are also being developed to test for ketosis (Jorritsma et al., 1998)
The heritability for ketosis is relatively high, and this trait should be used to advantage (Van Dorp et al., 1998; Zwald et al., 2004).  Additionally, there may be some variation in breed predisposition to ketosis (Schnier et al., 2004) although management has a much greater effect on farm than breeding
In the UK bull proofs a fertility index has been developed which can indirectly be used to reduce ketosis, as some of the factors contributing to it (milk yield and body condition score) are linked to the ketosis
Housing also seems to have an effect on the level of ketosis in the herd. Research from Norway indicates that a significantly higher proportion of herds with tie stalls experienced ketosis compared to those with free stall herds (Valde et al., 1997). The reason for this is not known but may lie in the fact that muscles can utilize ketone bodies","The key to prevention of ketosis is good transition cow management.

Check forage quality several times every year
Beef cows should receive adequate levels of high quality forage to prevent ketosis (pregnancy toxemia) in late pregnancy
Feed high quality roughage during early lactation
Use cows suitable to the farm system, i.e., do not breed for high yields in isolation
Ensure cows are not too fat at calving (condition score 2.5-3.0)
Introduce concentrates in small amounts approximately two weeks before calving
A suggested dry period ration would contain 50% of the lactating cow ration and 50% straw, to give an ME of 9MJ/kg DM and 14% CP
Avoid major dietary changes during early lactation
Avoid roughage high in butyric acid in early lactation
Use regular body condition scoring throughout the lactation. Look out for sudden changes in trends
Ensure that all cows have good access to feed, i.e., enough feeding space for the lower ranking cows. Pay particular attention to first lactation cows
Ensure adequate cobalt intakes
Take metabolic profiles in groups of dry cows and cows in early lactation to check whether the diet is adequate and maintain assurance that transition cow management is optimal",ketosis,6

8,"Primary ketosis, or acetonemia, is a metabolic disorder and is largely a disease that is influenced by management of dairy cows in early lactation. Ketosis is an important clinical and subclinical disease, as there are several metabolic disorders and diseases that commonly occur in the calving and the early lactation period  that are linked to ketosis (including milk fever, retained foetal membranes and displaced abomasum). Hypoglycemia is the major factor involved in the onset and development of clinical ketosis. There is a gradual loss of body condition over several days or even weeks. There is also a moderate to marked decline in milk yield (up to 5 liters per day) over five to six days before the onset of obvious clinical signs (Edwards and Tozer, 2004). This can persist for up to two weeks after diagnosis (Rajala-Schultz et al., 2001). The disease is most commonly seen in high-yielding dairy cows in early lactation. Secondary ketosis due to lack of appetite as a result of another disease can be seen at any stage of lactation. Beef cows may also suffer from ketosis during pregnancy, although this is less commonly recognized.","The season, ketosis is more likely in winter
Increasing parity
Cows with milk fever have a greater decrease in feed intake after calving which exacerbates the negative energy balance, increasing the risk of ketosis (Goff and Horst, 2003).

There are three main aims of treatment:

To restore blood glucose levels as quickly as possible
To replenish oxaloacetate, the essential intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), so that fatty acids are completely oxidized and the production of ketone bodies reduced
To increase the availability of dietary glycogenic precursors, notably propionic acid (Eddy, 2004)
Intravenous glucose therapy with 500 ml 40% glucose will give a short term rise in blood glucose levels that will only last 4 hours. It should be accompanied by oral administration of a glucose precursor, preferably propylene glycol. Administer propylene glycol twice daily for three to four days. Cobalt salts may be added to propylene glycol.","The following points should be considered:

Cows should not be too fat at calving, as this depresses their feed intakes. A condition score of 2.5-3.0 on a 1-5 scale is optimal, and anything higher is considered too fat and at greater risk of ketosis (Gillund et al., 2001; Melendez et al., 2004)
Concentrates fed during lactation should be introduced in small amounts, approximately two weeks before calving, to allow adjustments of the rumen microflora. Dietary changes during early lactation should be made gradually
Efforts should be made to ease the transition from gestation to lactation by offering highly palatable forage at calving and providing suitable accommodation and assistance where necessary (Grummer et al., 2004; Moorby et al., 2002)
Roughage high in butyric acid should be avoided in early lactation. Forage quality should be checked several times every year. In cobalt deficient areas, measures should be taken to ensure adequate cobalt intake (Eddy, 2004)
A sufficient supply of high quality forage is essential for beef cows in late pregnancy
Metabolic profiles using blood samples taken from groups of dry cows and cows in early lactation can help vets monitor the herd health and detect subclinical disease. Dietary changes can then be made if necessary to reduce disease. Milk tests are also being developed to test for ketosis (Jorritsma et al., 1998)
The heritability for ketosis is relatively high, and this trait should be used to advantage (Van Dorp et al., 1998; Zwald et al., 2004).  Additionally, there may be some variation in breed predisposition to ketosis (Schnier et al., 2004) although management has a much greater effect on farm than breeding

It is caused by Actinobacillus lignieresii, part of the normal bacterial flora of the upper digestive tract. The bacteria usually invade the skin through a wound or minor trauma caused by sticks, cereal awns or similar.","In an outbreak, it is important to identify the causative factors to the predisposing lacerations in the mouths of the affected animals. This is likely to be a feed source that, once identified, should be removed. Again, isolation of affected animals and effective treatment early are the best control measures to prevent further spread. If there is an outbreak of cutaneous actinobacillosis, rough objects in the environment (such as feed barriers) should be removed or modified to prevent skin abrasions allowing bacterial entry.","The disease is fairly acute, with swelling in the affected part, under the jaw and in the regional lymph nodes. The clinical symptoms are excess salivation, difficult mastication and inappetence. The condition is rarely seen as an outbreak in several animals simultaneously or but mostly as an individual case, often in association with a diet change.","Treatment of wooden tongue is usually successful if started early. However, if treatment of classic wooden tongue is started more than two weeks after the first symptoms and the animal has lost a lot of condition, the treatment is less likely to be successful and humane slaughter should be considered. However, treatment of cutaneous actinobacillosis has been successful even in cases of long standing (up to 6 months) infection (Milne et al., 2001).

A vet should always be involved if treatment for wooden tongue is attempted. Antibiotics are effective and should be the treatment of choice for this condition. Treatment with penicillin and streptomycin combinations have been successful, but may need to be continued for 2-3 weeks duration for complete resolution of long standing cutaneous disease (Milne et al., 2001; Dhand et al., 2002; Holzhauer and Roumen, 2002). At least in the initial phase non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should also be given to relieve the pain.","In the case of an isolated incident in an individual animal the best approach to prevention and control is to isolate and treat the animal at the first sign of symptoms. The animal should not be brought back into the main herd until all symptoms have disappeared as they are a potential source of infection to the rest of the herd.   As the causative bacteria do not survive more than 5 days in the environment and are present in the mouths of healthy cattle, the removal of the predisposing feed source is adequate to control the disease within a herd.

23,"Bovine fasciolosis is an economically important disease of cattle, which can be associated with particular regions throughout the world directly linked to the habitat of an aquatic mud snail. In Europe the snail species naturally infected with Fasciola hepatica (Liver fluke) is Galba trunculata, and in the USA multiple fresh water snail species belonging to the genus Lymnaea have been reported to harbor infection (Dunkel et al., 1996). In the UK bovine fasciolosis was historically more prominent in the wetter western half, although in recent years an increase in the number of cases of fasciolosis have been reported across the UK (Pritchard et al., 2005). This may be a result of a warmer, wetter climate, especially in the summer and movement of infected sheep (Daniel, 2004). One study suggests that 50-80% of dairy herds in England and Wales have lactating dairy cows that have been exposed to Fasciola hepatica infection (Salimi-Bejestani et al., 2005). Calves and yearlings are most commonly affected, but any age of animal may be susceptible. Climatic and hydrological factors play an important part in the epidemiology of the disease.","Bovine fasciolosis is an economically important disease of cattle, which can be associated with particular regions throughout the world directly linked to the habitat of an aquatic mud snail.

Weight loss
Anemia
Bottle jaw
Diarrhea
Constipation (Torgerson, 1999).","In dairy cattle which calve in the spring, treatment at drying off in the winter can be recommended. Young stock can be treated at the same time. Cows calving at other times of the year are more difficult to treat, as they may be lactating during the winter housing period. It may be possible to treat selectively cows with the heaviest burden of parasites (judged by fecal egg count) rather than blanket treating the whole herd. This will require close observation and regular fecal egg counts during the risk period. Only Abendazole and Oxyclosanide can be used during lactation (although they have long withdrawal periods, which makes use difficult), and these are only effective against adult fluke. In certain areas with high infestations, consideration should be given to synchronizing the calving pattern during the conversion period, so that the animals are not lactating during the period of maximum transmission in the autumn when treatment (against immature and mature fluke) can be given. Together with other management changes, this may be enough to keep liver fluke under control (Torgerson, 1999).","Fluke control measures can be divided into 3 sections:

1. Grazing management

24,"Bovine fasciolosis is an economically important disease of cattle, which can be associated with particular regions throughout the world directly linked to the habitat of an aquatic mud snail. In Europe the snail species naturally infected with Fasciola hepatica (Liver fluke) is Galba trunculata, and in the USA multiple fresh water snail species belonging to the genus Lymnaea have been reported to harbor infection (Dunkel et al., 1996). In the UK bovine fasciolosis was historically more prominent in the wetter western half, although in recent years an increase in the number of cases of fasciolosis have been reported across the UK (Pritchard et al., 2005). This may be a result of a warmer, wetter climate, especially in the summer and movement of infected sheep (Daniel, 2004). One study suggests that 50-80% of dairy herds in England and Wales have lactating dairy cows that have been exposed to Fasciola hepatica infection (Salimi-Bejestani et al., 2006). Calves and yearlings are most commonly affected, but any age of animal may be susceptible. Climatic and hydrological factors play an important part in the epidemiology of the disease.","Bovine fasciolosis is an economically important disease of cattle, which can be associated with particular regions throughout the world directly linked to the habitat of an aquatic mud snail.

30,"Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), was first recognized as a separate disease entity in 1986. The disease agent, a prion, is believed to be a scrapie-like agent (an infectious protein) that causes destruction of the grey matter in brain, leading to a progressive disease. The crucial event in the pathenogenesis of prion diseases is the conversion of the normally occurring cellular prion protein (PrPc) into a pathogenic form, called protease-resistant PrP (PrPres) or scrapie PrP (PrPsc) (Caramelli et al., 2006). BSE is USDA reportable disease.","It is currently believed that BSE originated from either sheep or cattle infected with a scrapie-like agent. Meat and bone meal made from infected animals was recycled back to susceptible cattle in feed, and infection followed. Changes in the processing of meat and bone meal in the early 1980s are believed to have allowed an increased infectivity build-up in the meal (Bradley, 2000). There is some evidence of maternal transmission of BSE to offspring, but it is suggested that this form of disease spread is not significant (Wilesmith et al., 1997). Although the theory of BSE originating from contaminated meat and bone meal is the most widely accepted, other theories about the origin of BSE have been developed. These include suggesting that factors including organophosphorous dipping and an excess of manganese rendered some animals more susceptible to infection than others (Purdey, 1994; Purdey, 2000) or that autoimmune disease may be responsible (Ebringer et al., 2005).","The clinical signs of BSE are highly varied and diagnosis may not always be straightforward (Konold et al., 2004; Saegerman et al., 2004).

33,"Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis. Bovine tuberculosis is a zoonotic disease and can cause tuberculosis in humans. bTb has been successfully eradicated from many developed countries including, Australia, most EU Member States, Switzerland, Canada and all but a few states in the USA (de la Rua-Domenech, 2006). EU Member states in which TB is endemic include the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Italy and Spain.","Control of bTB is important because of its potential zoonotic and also because of the severe economic effects of slaughter and movement restrictions required to control the disease. M. bovis is spread in a number of ways by infectious animals – in their breath, milk, discharging lesions, saliva, urine or feces. Cattle can become infectious long before they exhibit any obvious clinical signs or lesions typical of bTB, even with the most careful vet inspection (de la Rua-Domenech, 2006). However, they can spread disease around 87 days after infection occurs (Neill et al., 1991). Entry is usually by inhalation (especially if housed) or ingestion (when wildlife is the source of infection). Once in a herd, infection probably spreads from cow to cow by inhalation (Costello et al., 1998), and transmission from cows to calves may occur via the milk or colostrum (Evangelista and De Anda, 1996).","Tuberculosis is rarely diagnosed clinically. Various body systems can be affected, but signs are usually confined to the respiratory tract. A soft, chronic cough occurs once or twice at a time. In more advanced cases, there is a marked increase in the depth and rate of respiration as well as dyspnoea. Areas of dullness can be heard in the chest on auscultation or percussion. Some cases may squeak, whistle or have a snoring respiration (Andrews, 1992; Cassidy et al., 1999). Lymph node enlargement may present as localized swellings, or may cause dyspnoea or dysphagia (Cobner, 2003).","All animals affected by tuberculosis are compulsorily slaughtered, and restrictions are placed so that animals may not be moved on or off the affected farm (except direct to slaughter under license) until further tests show that the herd is clear.","Systematic and routine testing aided by compulsory slaughter of reactors, movement restrictions for affected herds and slaughterhouse surveillance. bTB is a notifiable disease and any suspect cases should be notified to the authorities.

There are two types of bTB tests used internationally, the skin test and the IFN-gamma test.","Establish a closed herd system and breed own replacement. Every purchase is a risk
Prevent contact between your cattle and those on neighboring farms; use sound fencing to stop nose to nose contact; place barriers in gateways to stop contact with passing cattle
Keep contract reared cattle away from your herd
Isolate any bought-in animals
Check when bought-in cattle were last TB tested. If they need testing before your routine herd test, consider a private TB test, or consider whether a compulsory pre-movement test is required
If you share livestock vehicles, ensure they are disinfected
If possible, avoid common grazing, however if it is inevitable, then routine skin tests should be synchronized
Tell neighbors if you have a TB breakdown to enable them to take precautions
If a breakdown occurs, do not use pooled colostrum to feed calves as this may spread disease",bovine tuberculosis,33

EU Member states in which TB is endemic include the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Italy and Spain.","Control of bTB is important because of its potential zoonotic and also because of the severe economic effects of slaughter and movement restrictions required to control the disease. M. bovis is spread in a number of ways by infectious animals – in their breath, milk, discharging lesions, saliva, urine or feces. Cattle can become infectious long before they exhibit any obvious clinical signs or lesions typical of bTB, even with the most careful vet inspection (de la Rua-Domenech, 2006). However, they can spread disease around 87 days after infection occurs (Neill et al., 1991). Entry is usually by inhalation (especially if housed) or ingestion (when wildlife is the source of infection). Once in a herd, infection probably spreads from cow to cow by inhalation (Costello et al., 1998), and transmission from cows to calves may occur via the milk or colostrum (Evangelista and De Anda, 1997).","Tuberculosis is rarely diagnosed clinically. Various body systems can be affected, but signs are usually confined to the respiratory tract. A soft, chronic cough occurs once or twice at a time. In more advanced cases, there is a marked increase in the depth and rate of respiration as well as dyspnoea. Areas of dullness can be heard in the chest on auscultation or percussion. Some cases may squeak, whistle or have a snoring respiration (Andrews, 1992; Cassidy et al., 1999). Lymph node enlargement may present as localized swellings, or may cause dyspnoea or dysphagia (Cobner, 2004).","All animals affected by tuberculosis are compulsorily slaughtered, and restrictions are placed so that animals may not be moved on or off the affected farm (except direct to slaughter under license) until further tests show that the herd is clear.","Systematic and routine testing aided by compulsory slaughter of reactors, movement restrictions for affected herds and slaughterhouse surveillance. bTB is a notifiable disease and any suspect cases should be notified to the authorities.

39,"Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide, potentially causing chronic illness in people, particularly in developing countries. The link between brucellosis in wildlife and livestock is also a concern. Brucellosis can affect all farm livestock but in cattle the disease is caused by the facultative intracellular bacterium Brucella abortus, and as the name suggests this causes late stage abortions in cattle, placentitis, which produces weak new-born calves and infertility in cows and bulls (Neta et al., 2010). After the first episode of Brucella-induced abortion, the cow often has normal subsequent births, although other abortions may occur (Nicoletti, 1984).","Aborted fetuses, fetal membranes and uterine secretions are the most important sources of infection (Samartino and Enright, 1993). The disease can also be transmitted in utero, and via infected milk. Calves that acquire infection in-utero, or via infected milk, may show signs of disease or remain asymptomatic. However heifers with latent asymptomatic infection may abort, or give birth to infected calves, which are central in maintaining a disease within a herd (Nicoletti, 1984).","The disease often presents as an outbreak of abortion, so notification of unexpected abortions forms an important part of surveillance. In many situations, disease outbreaks associated with imported cattle, for example from the Republic of Ireland (Blissit et al., 2005) and Northern Ireland to mainland Britain, have been considered to constitute a significant risk to disease introduction (Jones et al., 2004). Brucellosis is also found in other European countries, particularly in southern European countries where the disease is found in small ruminants and has a variable wildlife reservoir (Godfroid and Käsbohrer, 2002). Therefore testing of animals after importation is an important control measure.","There is no specific treatment in confirmed infected animals.

40,"Milk fever is caused by a temporary blood calcium deficiency (also known as hypocalcemia) which usually occurs around the time of calving and is one of the most common metabolic disorder in dairy cattle. This condition is a common cause of poor labor (dystocia), stillborn calves and apparent sudden death of dairy cows.","Hypocalcemia appears to be more common when dry cows are fed grass, rather than conserved fodder especially during long wet spells of weather. Another predisposing factor is breed, with the Jersey and, to a lesser extent, the Guernsey being particularly susceptible to milk fever. This is probably due to the relatively high production level for small breeds. The incidence of the disease also increases with lactation number. The reason is thought to be the increasing requirement for calcium at calving as milk yield increases with each lactation, and the ability to mobilize calcium from the skeleton decreases with age (Eddy, 1992).","The incidence of milk fever is variable, but a national survey suggested that 5.9% of cows will develop clinical milk fever each year in the United States (Goff and Horst, 2003b), although it tends to be lower in first parity cows with the risk increasing with subsequent lactations. Subclinical hypocalcemia can potentially have widespread effects on the cow that predispose her to other metabolic and periparturient diseases (Curtis et al., 1983). Cows with milk fever have a higher plasma cortisol concentration which may exacerbate the immunosupression normal at calving. Additionally, the loss of muscle tone in the teat sphincter and the uterus may increase the risk of mastitis, retained fetal membranes, endometritis and uterine prolapse. A reduction in appetite may exacerbate the negative energy balance after calving and increase the risk of ketosis and displaced abomasum, all of which can impact on subsequent fertility in later lactation (Chebel et al., 2004; Maizon et al., 2004).","Treat cases of milk fever as soon as possible with a slow intravenous infusion of 8-12 g of calcium

Also, animals should be prevented from becoming overfat or having large changes in body condition score and cows should be given plenty of exercise (Chamberlain, 2003).

Ensure the diet of cows in late pregnancy is sufficient in magnesium to maintain plasma magnesium concentrations greater than 0.85 mmol/liter (1.8 mg/ 100 ml) as this aids parathyroid hormone production and release (Sansom et al., 1983; Husband, 2005). The calcium intake during the dry period should be kept below 50 g/day (ideally below 20g/day) in order to improve the efficiency of calcium absorption and mobilization (Horst, 1986; Thilsing-Hansen et al., 2002). However, just before calving the calcium in the diet can be increased to ensure adequate calcium is available over the risk period.

46,"Calf pneumonia is a respiratory disease caused by inflammation in the lungs, primarily the alveoli (air sacs). It is a multifactorial disease caused by a range of organisms including viruses, bacteria and mycoplasmas. Environmental factors are also extremely crucial in managing the disease. Calf pneumonia can potentially be a significant economic burden to a farm, due to the costs of treatment, mortalities, reduced growth rates, additional labor and housing requirements (Andrews, 2000; van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2001). ","Pneumonia in calves is a multifactorial disease. Infectious agents (pathogens), environment, management and the immune status of the calves are factors in determining the outcome of an infection.","Dairy calves are likely to suffer from the disease at any age, with it manifesting itself as a chronic, coughing pneumonia, or as a more acute, enzootic calf pneumonia. Older dairy calves are also vulnerable after housing in the autumn. Suckler calves are more likely to suffer from respiratory disease between two and five months of age, following weaning or transport from one herd to another. Outdoor reared beef suckler calves can also be severely affected by pneumonia (Peters, 1986; Scott, 1997).","There are a number of investigative techniques that can be used in the face of a pneumonia outbreak. These include:

Taking nasal swabs and / or bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) samples for bacterial culture and virus isolation
Paired blood samples can be taken to assess serological immune response to respiratory pathogens. However, reliance on paired serological testing must be done with caution as false negatives (failure to seroconvert) can occur in young calves less than 3 months old (Virtala et al., 1999).","The incidence and severity of calf pneumonia is closely allied with management and disease patterns on farms and so the best approach is to implement a control program tailored to the individual farm’s needs.

Whether or not cobalt deficiency is the reason behind the animal’s poor performance can be attempted to be established by measuring the plasma B12 level of the animal in question. However, plasma B12 is not always very reliable as a measure of available B12 due to the strong binding of plasma proteins to B12, which may make it unavailable for detection in testing. Liver B12 may be a more useful measurement of B12 status if possible, where concentrations below 300nmol/kg FW are indicative of marginal cobalt status (Suttle, 2004).

The clinical symptoms vary depending on the animal’s susceptibility and other contributing factors such as environment, season and strain of bacteria (McConnel et al., 2007) but the main symptoms are runny eyes, red and inflamed conjunctiva and corneal ulcers in the later stages of infection. Tremendous economic losses stem from inappetance and poor weight gain in affected animals suffering from ocular pain and visual impairment (McConnel et al., 2007).","The causative agent is a bacterium Moraxella bovis although this organism is not isolated from every case, and unaffected carrier animals are also found (Watson, 2004). The condition is seen commonly during the summer months. It is suspected that ultraviolet light, dust, face fly population, concurrent pathogens, climate, and pasture conditions act as predisposing factors (Baptista, 1979; Watson, 2004). Young animals are more susceptible than older animals and exhibit more severe clinical symptoms, which can lead to significant depression of growth (Snowder et al., 2005).

Cattle and sheep are commonly affected, but other species, including man and horse, can be infected. Thus, ringworm is a potential zoonotic disease. ","Clinical signs are often seen in the winter during the housed period.  Circular lesions are characteristically grey-white, with a powdery surface and scant hairs. Lesions can be slightly raised and swollen, particularly around the edges. Severe lesions can become thickened with scales and leave raw, bleeding surface when the scaly lesion is removed. The lesions do not normally cause irritation or generalised symptoms in affected animals. In cattle, the infection is most commonly seen in calves and young stock, where the lesions are mainly seen around the eyes, on the ears and on the back. The lesions are less rare in adult cattle and are seen when infection is introduced into a naïve herd, for example by purchase of new stock. Additionally, because immunity is not long-lived, adults can develop clinical signs if exposed to a heavy challenge from young stock.","Animals often self-cure following turn-out in the spring, with many cases not requiring specific treatment. Treatment of ringworm with topical anti-fungal preparations has been used widely and provides reasonable cure rates (Rhaymah, 1999; Andrews and Edwardson, 1986).

Thiabendazole has been indicated to have efficacy in ringworm treatment and may be considered (Guth, 1988), however, it is important to remember that this is primarily an anthelmintic drug and additional use should be limited in order to prevent anthelmintic resistance. ","As the disease is particularly common in young stock during the housing period and in crowded conditions, control should focus on providing good housing conditions, disinfection and cleaning of the premises during the grazing season and immediate isolation and treatment of affected animals.

Cattle and sheep are commonly affected, but other species, including man and horse, can be infected. Thus, ringworm is a potential zoonotic disease. ","Clinical signs are often seen in the winter during the housed period.  Circular lesions are characteristically grey-white, with a powdery surface and scant hairs. Lesions can be slightly raised and swollen, particularly around the edges. Severe lesions can become thickened with scales and leave raw, bleeding surface when the scaly lesion is removed. The lesions do not normally cause irritation or generalised symptoms in affected animals. In cattle, the infection is most commonly seen in calves and young stock, where the lesions are mainly seen around the eyes, on the ears and on the back. The lesions are less rare in adult cattle and are seen when infection is introduced into a naïve herd, for example by purchase of new stock. Additionally, because immunity is not long-lived, adults can develop clinical signs if exposed to a heavy challenge from young stock.","Animals often self-cure following turn-out in the spring, with many cases not requiring specific treatment. Treatment of ringworm with topical anti-fungal preparations has been used widely and provides reasonable cure rates (Rhaymah, 1999; Andrews and Edwardson, 1986).

Thiabendazole has been indicated to have efficacy in ringworm treatment and may be considered (Guth, 1989), however, it is important to remember that this is primarily an anthelmintic drug and additional use should be limited in order to prevent anthelmintic resistance.","As the disease is particularly common in young stock during the housing period and in crowded conditions, control should focus on providing good housing conditions, disinfection and cleaning of the premises during the grazing season and immediate isolation and treatment of affected animals. Phenolic disinfectants or sodium hypochlorite are recommended for disinfection of buildings and grooming and feeding utensils. Buildings can also be sprayed with caustic soda (2% solution). Formaldehyde is not recommended on pasture based farming systems.","If ringworm is a continuous problem on the farm:

Implement a closed herd policy
Include a ringworm reduction plan in the animal health plan
Consider vaccinating all young stock and treating all affected animals at turnout (plan phasing out of vaccination once clinical incidence disappears)
Disinfect all buildings and utensils (see Prevention and Control), and burn or thoroughly compost all bedding
During the following housing period, isolate and treat all affected animals immediately at diagnosis
Repeat vaccination and disinfection at next turnout
If ringworm is not a problem on the farm:

Implement a closed herd policy.
Check the health status of herd of origin regarding ringworm if you consider buying animals

Lameness is a common problem in all classes of cattle and can greatly affect the welfare and productivity of the animals. Lameness is not a single disease but a symptom associated with a range of different conditions. Herd prevalence rates can vary hugely between farms because many factors can predispose clinical lameness and because of differences in stockmanship and farm environments (Vaarst et al., 1998). A recent study by Barker and colleagues who surveyed 205 dairy farms across England and Wales reports a mean prevalence of lameness as 36.8% (Barker et al., 2010). Espejo and colleagues reported a mean prevalence of 24.6% in high-producing Holstein cows housed in freestall barns in Minnesota (Espejo et al., 2006).","There are a large number of factors contributing to lameness in cattle. These can be broken down into environmental, management and animal factors, with the physiological effects of parturition suggested to be a major factor affecting lameness development (Webster et al., 2005).  visit website(https://www.farmhealthonline.com/US/disease-management/cattle-diseases/lameness/)","the following diseases that are associated with lameness:

hock damage and carpal hygromas.","The treatments below are targeted at the specific causes of lameness, however there are several basic treatments that are common to many foot condition with the aim of reducing the pain and encouraging healing:

Footbaths – these are not only good for preventing lameness but can also be used to treat it
Pain control – consult your vet about different pain relief options and
Foot blocks – these are used to treat a diseased claw, a block is applied to the adjacent sound claw will immobilize the affected claw. However, there is little benefit using blocks if the animal is going to be put back into a straw environment (Watson, 2007).","On farms where lameness in cattle is a problem, effective changes to housing and management must be made to address the problem. Changes to housing may require a major investment on the farmers’ part. Whay and Main (1999) suggest that a combination of lameness incidence and prevalence data can provide a broad base of information which can form the cornerstone of any prevention program. Therefore a lameness recording system should be initiated.

Lameness records should include the following information:
cow number
date
affected limb
lesion/disease type
treatments
outcome of the treatment
Select breeding bulls with high ‘locomotion’ indices
The feet of any bought-in animals should be thoroughly checked for lesions and given a footbath in zinc or copper sulfate. The animals should preferably be bought from a herd that has no known history of digital dermatitis or foot rot
Preference should be given to keeping animals in straw yards over winter; use adequate bedding and hygienic measures
If cubicles are used, these should be of good design and adequate bedding used to ensure comfortable lying times and prevent injuries
Maintain concrete surfaces on the farm in good condition to reduce bruising of the sole
Scrape slurry frequently to improve overall foot health
Improve cow track conditions to reduce sole penetration and bruising
Prevent the development of lameness lesions by applying sound routines of foot bathing and foot trimming
Minimize the risk of laminitis by adopting feeding practices that promote good rumen function, particularly in early lactation
Ensure healthy feet in first lactation heifers to minimize lameness. They should, preferably, be kept separately from older cows during the first lactation and housed in straw yards
Monitor feet health by regular herd ‘walk past’ and locomotion scoring and/or feet examination on individual cows at routine trimming to detect problems early and correct accordingly",lameness,73

Additionally, among calves aged 1-4 months old, carriage of VTEC E. coli O157 was reduced if the calf had suckled colostrum from the mother or if the calf had stayed more than 2 days with the mother after calving (Rugbjerg et al., 2006).","1, Maintenance of immune status
Provide adequate bedding to allow the calf to stand without difficulty
Ensure early feeding, assist if needed, monitor the intake as closely as possible and record it (“maximum supervision, minimum interference”)
Keep a supply of frozen colostrum in case the dam leaks colostrum before calving
Outdoor calving
Feed fresh or fermented colostrum to all calves up to three weeks of age
In cases where ETEC has been identified as a herd problem, immunize pregnant dams before calving as part of a targeted control plan.   5, Minimization of exposure
Provide adequate numbers of calving pens and clean and disinfect them between batches
House calves well away from the calving pens
Keep up high hygiene standards throughout the calving period and in calf housing
Keep the infection out of the herd if not present, by a closed herd policy and the avoidance of visitors from other farms, unless precautions are taken.",septicemic colibacillosis,77

80,"Calf pneumonia is a respiratory disease caused by inflammation in the lungs, primarily the alveoli (air sacs). It is a multifactorial disease caused by a range of organisms including viruses, bacteria and mycoplasmas. Environmental factors are also extremely crucial in managing the disease. Calf pneumonia can potentially be a significant economic burden to a farm, due to the costs of treatment, mortalities, reduced growth rates, additional labor and housing requirements (Andrews, 2000; van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2001). Respiratory diseases in young animals were ranked very low in importance in a survey of British organic beef and dairy farmers (Roderick and Hovi, 1999). Late weaning, a whole milk diet, the requirement for good housing standards and a closed herd policy reduce the risk factors for respiratory disease in calves.","Inadequate ventilation of calf barns increases the risk of disease due to the buildup of humidity, noxious gases, dust and bacteria content (Lorenz et al., 2011). The main environmental risk factor predisposing calves to respiratory disease is poor ventilation in calf housing (Pritchard, 1982). Cold, humid conditions, sudden changes in air temperature, stress due to different causes and change in the environment have also been associated with outbreaks of pneumonia in young calves (Phillippo et al., 1987; Roe, 1982; Scott, 1995; Webster et al., 1985).

Inadequate intake of colostrum or poor quality colostrum will affect the calves’ defense against respiratory agents and make them more susceptible to infection (Virtala et al., 1999). Rearing systems where calves of different origin are mixed together at a young age suffer from high levels of respiratory diseases (Gibbs, 2001). Large, shared air spaces, calves from different age groups and poor sanitation between calf batches often make these systems even more vulnerable (Losinger and Heinrichs, 1996). The stress associated with management procedures such as disbudding and castration may also be associated with a high respiratory disease incidence.","Calf pneumonia is a respiratory disease caused by inflammation in the lungs, primarily the alveoli (air sacs).

85,"Also known as: Flabby Bag, Milk Drop Syndrome

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, caused by bacteria of genus Leptospira. The disease that affects cattle (and man) in the UK is caused by two serogroups of the serovar Leptospira hardjo.  The serovar Leptospirosis pomona has not been found  in cattle in the UK or continental Europe, whereas it is important in New Zealand, Australia, North and South America.","The major risk factors for Leptospira infection in cattle are herd size, river access, sheep co-grazed with cows (as sheep can act as non-symptomatic carriers), inadequate husbandry practices, hired bulls and purchased animals (Bennett, 1991; van der Kamp et al., 1990; Ryan et al., 2012; van Schaik et al., 2002). The most common approaches to the control of leptospirosis in cattle are based on prevention of exposure, vaccination and selective treatment (Bolin, 2001).","Milk Drop and Leptospirosis
In dairy cattle, acute disease may be seen as a drop in milk yield in all infected animals. This can be accompanied by transient fever, mastitis-like changes in the milk and sudden loss of all milk with flaccid udder (flabby bag). Recovery can take up to 10 days.

Abortion and Leptospirosis
In herds contracting the infection for the first time, up to 30% of the animals may abort (Ellis, 1994)The abortion usually occurs 6-12 weeks after the initial infection. If the infection occurs in the late gestation, an infected calf may be born. Diagnosis of leptospiral abortion is difficult and based on maternal and fetal serology, as no obvious lesions are associated with the infection.

Infertility and Leptospirosis
The main affect of infection on fertility is low pregnancy rates and subsequent high culling rates. The symptoms vary in a herd depending on the status of the infection:

In a chronic inactive state, very few signs of poor fertility are seen
In an active acute infection, the symptoms are more apparent.","Antibiotic treatment or combined antibiotic and vaccination therapy of cows suffering from active Leptospira-infection have been shown to eliminate infection or alleviate clinical signs during an outbreak and in treatment trials (Alt et al., 2001; Gerritsen et al., 1994; Kingscote and Proulx, 1986). Streptomycin and dihdro-streptomycin have been the antibiotics of choice for the treatment (Ellis et al., 1985), but their use at the recommended dose of 25 mg/kg is extra-label in the UK.  Amoxycillin oxtetracycline, tilmicosin and ceftiofur, have shown some promise in treatment (Alt et al., 2001; Smith et al., 1997). Animals entering an accredited herd should be treated with either dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline to eliminate chronic renal infection before they mix with the rest of the herd (Bolin, 2001).","When decisions are made concerning prevention and control of leptospiral infection in a herd, it is important to find out what the present health status of the herd is. In dairy herds, this can be done simply and cheaply by testing for L. hardjo infection in the bulk tank milk. This test is accurate enough to tell whether the herd has been exposed to the disease and approximately how many animals might be infected (Pritchard, 2001, 1999). Individual blood sampling of suspect animals can then be used to clarify the picture. In beef herds, the herd history may give an indication of the herd status. Otherwise, a representative sample of different parity cows need to be blood-sampled and tested for antibodies. Once the herd’s infection status has been investigated, approaches to control and eradication can be decided upon.","If the herd is free of infection or the antibody status indicates a very low level of infection (only possible in non-vaccinated herds):

Establish a closed herd policy (if animals are bought in, quarantine for 4 weeks and test for antibodies plus treat with antibiotics as a safety measure)
Prevent access to shared surface water
Prevent access to and contact with neighboring herds
Do not mix cattle with sheep, unless sheep are known to be free of infection
Consider accreditation for freedom from the disease – particularly if raw milk used or breeding animals sold (CHeCS)
Consider establishing a monitoring scheme to be aware of any changes in the situation (CHeCS)
If the herd is infected:

Establish closed herd policy and biosecurity as above and start vaccinating. It is impossible to monitor disease as the tests are incapable of differentiating between infection and reaction to vaccine. It can, however, be expected that the infection will gradually disappear from the herd as young uninfected animals enter the herd and new infections are prevented by vaccine use. If the measures to prevent new infection from outside the herd are good, vaccination can be discontinued after a few years, depending on the herd’s initial situation
Before discontinuing vaccination, discuss with the farm vet to assess the preventive measures and the local epidemiology of the disease",flabby bag,85

Amoxycillin oxtetracycline, tilmicosin and ceftiofur, have shown some promise in treatment (Alt et al., 2001; Smith et al., 1997). Animals entering an accredited herd should be treated with either dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline to eliminate chronic renal infection before they mix with the rest of the herd (Bolin, 2002).","When decisions are made concerning prevention and control of leptospiral infection in a herd, it is important to find out what the present health status of the herd is. In dairy herds, this can be done simply and cheaply by testing for L. hardjo infection in the bulk tank milk. This test is accurate enough to tell whether the herd has been exposed to the disease and approximately how many animals might be infected (Pritchard, 2001, 2000). Individual blood sampling of suspect animals can then be used to clarify the picture. In beef herds, the herd history may give an indication of the herd status. Otherwise, a representative sample of different parity cows need to be blood-sampled and tested for antibodies. Once the herd’s infection status has been investigated, approaches to control and eradication can be decided upon.","If the herd is free of infection or the antibody status indicates a very low level of infection (only possible in non-vaccinated herds):

Establish a closed herd policy (if animals are bought in, quarantine for 5 weeks and test for antibodies plus treat with antibiotics as a safety measure)
Prevent access to shared surface water
Prevent access to and contact with neighboring herds
Do not mix cattle with sheep, unless sheep are known to be free of infection
Consider accreditation for freedom from the disease – particularly if raw milk used or breeding animals sold (CHeCS)
Consider establishing a monitoring scheme to be aware of any changes in the situation (CHeCS)
If the herd is infected:

Establish closed herd policy and biosecurity as above and start vaccinating. It is impossible to monitor disease as the tests are incapable of differentiating between infection and reaction to vaccine. It can, however, be expected that the infection will gradually disappear from the herd as young uninfected animals enter the herd and new infections are prevented by vaccine use. If the measures to prevent new infection from outside the herd are good, vaccination can be discontinued after a few years, depending on the herd’s initial situation

87,"Also known as: Flabby Bag, Milk Drop Syndrome

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, caused by bacteria of genus Leptospira. The disease that affects cattle (and man) in the UK is caused by two serogroups of the serovar Leptospira hardjo.  The serovar Leptospirosis pomona has not been found  in cattle in the UK or continental Europe, whereas it is important in New Zealand, Australia, North and South America.","The major risk factors for Leptospira infection in cattle are herd size, river access, sheep co-grazed with cows (as sheep can act as non-symptomatic carriers), inadequate husbandry practices, hired bulls and purchased animals (Bennett, 1991; van der Kamp et al., 1990; Ryan et al., 2012; van Schaik et al., 2002). The most common approaches to the control of leptospirosis in cattle are based on prevention of exposure, vaccination and selective treatment (Bolin, 2003).","Milk Drop and Leptospirosis
In dairy cattle, acute disease may be seen as a drop in milk yield in all infected animals. This can be accompanied by transient fever, mastitis-like changes in the milk and sudden loss of all milk with flaccid udder (flabby bag). Recovery can take up to 10 days.

Abortion and Leptospirosis
In herds contracting the infection for the first time, up to 30% of the animals may abort (Ellis, 1994)The abortion usually occurs 6-14 weeks after the initial infection. If the infection occurs in the late gestation, an infected calf may be born. Diagnosis of leptospiral abortion is difficult and based on maternal and fetal serology, as no obvious lesions are associated with the infection.

Infertility and Leptospirosis
The main affect of infection on fertility is low pregnancy rates and subsequent high culling rates. The symptoms vary in a herd depending on the status of the infection:

In a chronic inactive state, very few signs of poor fertility are seen
In an active acute infection, the symptoms are more apparent.","Antibiotic treatment or combined antibiotic and vaccination therapy of cows suffering from active Leptospira-infection have been shown to eliminate infection or alleviate clinical signs during an outbreak and in treatment trials (Alt et al., 2001; Gerritsen et al., 1994; Kingscote and Proulx, 1986).

Cattle need a continuous supply of magnesium primarily to facilitate the numerous energy-generating reactions in their tissues and for the correct transmission of nerve pulses. The kidneys maintain magnesium homeostasis, and a renal threshold exists below which magnesium excretion is sharply reduced. Cattle rely on absorption of magnesium from the rumen to meet most of their needs. The animal cannot modify magnesium absorption and absorbs only a small proportion (<30%) of the magnesium consumed.","1, The occurrence of lactation or grass tetany can occur in three sets of circumstances. Most common is the occurrence in lactating dairy cows after turnout onto lush, grass-dominant pasture following winter housing. Most cases occur during the first 2 weeks after the animals leave the housing. Second, wheat pasture poisoning may occur in cattle of any age grazed on all types (including barley and oats) of green cereal crops in early stages of growth. The third occurrence is in beef or dry dairy cattle running at pasture in the winter time, usually when nutrition is insufficient and where no shelter is provided in changeable weather, rather than in severe, prolonged cold weather (Blood and Radostits, 1989). 2, While colostrums are high in magnesium,  milk is an inadequate source of magnesium for growing calves. Additionally, the ability of absorbing magnesium from the intestine decreases as the calf grows. Therefore, the condition most commonly occurs in milk-fed calves (e.g., sucklers) at three to four months of ages.","1, The clinical signs of lactation tetany are muscular spasms and convulsions, and death due to respiratory failure. Progression of disease is rapid, with animals often found as a ‘sudden death’. In this case, the major differential diagnosis which must be considered for statutory disease control reasons is anthrax, but clostridial diseases are the second biggest cause for sudden deaths. Hypomagnesemia can often be suspected based on the clinical presentation of a dead animal surrounded by churned-up ground as a consequence if fitting. Although effective treatment is available, the mortality rate is high because of the short course. Since animals die before they can be observed to be ill, the mortality rate is difficult to estimate. It is probably in the order of 20%.   2, Tetany does not occur until serum magnesium levels fall below 0.8 mg/dl (0.33 mmol/l), and is most severe at levels below 0.6 mg/dl (0.25 mmol/l), although calves may have levels even lower than this and show few clinical signs. It is probable that hypocalcemia hastens tetany in animals that are tetany-prone as a result of having low serum magnesium levels. Post-mortem, samples can be obtained from the aqueous or vitreous humor of the eye (Kolb, 2003; Edwards and Foster, 2009) to aid in confirmation of diagnosis since blood concentrations do not remain stable after death.
","Lactation tetany is not usually diagnosed in cows until individuals have developed clinical signs. They should be treated without delay by subcutaneous magnesium sulfate. A ‘fitting’ animal may need to be sedated first for safe handling by the vet and the stockperson. Cows with lactation tetany are often also low in calcium as well as magnesium. It is therefore recommended to use a combined treatment of subcutaneous magnesium sulfate first, followed by intravenous calcium borogluconate and magnesium hypophosphite. Care should always be taken when administering magnesium, especially if in a combined product which is given intravenously, as sudden death may be precipitated. Recovery is generally rapid but relapses are not uncommon and the treatment may have to be repeated.","The average dietary requirements of magnesium for cows is 1.3 g mg/kg DM for pastures high in potassium  and 0.6 g mg/kg DM for pastures low in potassium (Suttle, 1998). The feeding of magnesium salts to cows during the danger period is universally adopted. In-feed magnesium oxide (magnesite) (120 g/day), magnesium phosphate (54 g/day) and Epsom salts (MgSO4) are a safe and effective way of ensuring a good intake of magnesium.

Acute infection is due to high levels of blood loss, resulting in the rapid development of anemia and death. Acute haemonchoisis is most common in young stock or adults in poor condition that cannot compensate for the blood loss with the rate of production of new red blood cells
Sub-acute haemonchosis is when blood loss through worm infection is compensated by red blood cell production. This is not maintainable as the bone marrow will become depleted and disease will often become acute
Chronic haemonchosis is when the host is able to compensate with red blood cell production to a moderate level, although protein loss is gradual as is the loss in condition and pallor","Haemonchus Vaccine

98,"Mastitis is generally defined as the inflammation of the mammary gland. It is a costly and complex disease with variable origin, severity and outcome depending on the environment pathogen and host (Thompson-Crispi et al., 2014). The bovine mammary gland is an extraordinary organ that is able to produce more than 6000 kg milk per lactation, and damage to the mammary tissue reduces the number and activity of milk producing epithelial cells and contributes to decreased milk production, reduced milk quality, decline in animal health and welfare, and added cost of treatment.   There are four main clinical presentations of mastitis recognized:

Severe and acute toxic mastitis
Mild/moderate clinical mastitis
Sub-clinical mastitis
Summer mastitis       visit website (https://www.farmhealthonline.com/US/disease-management/cattle-diseases/mastitis/)","Today, mastitis is considered to be a multifactorial disease, closely related to the production system and environment that the cows are kept in.

Pathogens
Host determinants
Environmental determinants","There are four main clinical presentations of mastitis recognized:

Severe and acute toxic mastitis
Mild/moderate clinical mastitis
Sub-clinical mastitis
Summer mastitis
Severe and Acute Toxic Mastitis
This type of mastitis is often seen in cows in the period soon after calving and may be more frequent in cows with lower SCC. It is primarily caused by Gram-negative, endotoxin producing bacteria, such as E. coli, although in some cases S. aureus can be the pathogen. This type of mastitis is very severe and may kill cows unless they are treated promptly. The signs are primarily due to the endotoxin produced by the bacteria, causing the cow to develop endotoxic (also known as toxaemic) shock. The cow will present as acutely sick, dull, and may be recumbent. She may have a high temperature or conversely may have a sub-normal temperature if in shock. The udder may show a variety of changes including swelling, heat, pain and the milk may look watery and discolored though often not with ‘clots’. The cow must be immediately treated by a vet.

Mild/Moderate Clinical Mastitis
This type of mastitis is what is commonly recognized as a clinical case. At milking time the cow is often noticed to have abnormal milk (mild case), and in moderate cases a swollen udder, affecting one or more quarters. The cow is not systemically ill and appears bright and eating normally. She may show some signs of discomfort when walking due to a distended udder. A number of bacteria, mycoplasmas, yeasts and fungi can cause clinical mastitis.

Sub-clinical Mastitis
This type of mastitis does not cause obvious visible changes to the milk, but there may be some chronic inflammatory changes to the udder detected as hardness or ‘knotty’ tissue on palpation of the affected quarter(s). If tested with a California Mastitis Test (CMT) there is normally a reaction due to the increased SCC of milk produced by cows with chronic subclinical mastitis. Several pathogens are associated with this type of mastitis, especially S. aureus and S. uberis. This type of mastitis is important as cows can be a reservoir of infection for the rest of the herd, with pathogens spread during milking. Additionally, the milk may have changes in the amounts of milk solids (protein and fat) present as well as a high SCC count which, if present in a high proportion of cows in the herd may affect the bulk tank milk composition sufficiently to affect the price paid. Lastly, and importantly, these cases may flare-up periodically and cause clinical disease with associated painful symptoms for the cow, which is a concern regarding animal welfare.    Summer Mastitis
Classically, this type of mastitis is seen in dry cows in the late summer period and is associated with a spread of infectious mastitis-causing organisms by flies or by teat damage to dry cows. It can occur also in open heifers. This type of mastitis is mainly due to a combined effect of several bacteria. Arcanobacterium pyogenes is the primary organism, but the severity of clinical signs depends also on the other, often anaerobic bacteria present which can include Peptococcus indolicus, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium necrophorum and their production of endotoxin (Hillerton, 2004). The clinical signs vary and in the early stages may not be seen as cows are not as easily observed when dry as when they are going through a milking parlor. However, the infection will spread rapidly and can cause severe swelling of the udder with a foul-smelling discharge or secretion from the affected quarter(s). The cow may become very dull and depressed, especially if there is production of endotoxin and may develop a very high temperature. Severely affected cows may abort. Cows which are very dull and/or abort should be examined by a vet. Often, the cow or heifer will end up with a permanently non-functional (blind) quarter due to the severity of the inflammation and damage that occurs.","A healthy bovine udder should have the capacity to clear itself of infection without therapy. In the case of some pathogens, like E. coli, the self-cure rates can be as high as 90% (Sandholm, 1995a). The purpose of mastitis therapy is to assist the affected quarter to clear infection as rapidly as possible and to enable a quick return to normal milk production. The therapy should also be directed to alleviating pain and discomfort caused by inflammation associated with mastitis except in cases of toxic mastitis where treatment is an emergency and should be undertaken by a vet immediately.","Parts of the ‘Five Point Plan for Control Of Mastitis in Dairy Herds’ are still relevant but time have moved on in many aspects:

Routine post milking teat dipping or spraying is still recommended on most dairies except those with very low cell counts and a problem with severe environmental mastitis (see above)
The prompt treatment of clinical mastitis with antibiotics is still important, however, a more selective approach is increasingly adopted in North America and Europe (see below). This is based on different self cure rates of different pathogens and the availability of on farm test kits.

Microbial contamination of the reproductive tract at and just after parturition can be considered to be a normal feature, with infection eliminated by the cow’s own immune defense mechanisms and not causing a severe problem (Sheldon et al., 2006). However, in some cases, infection overwhelms the cow’s ability to respond and a number of conditions may occur. Post-partum conditions can cause low conception rates both in the first-lactation and in older cows and negatively impacts on the proportion of pregnant cows at 300 days (Toni et al., 2015).","Including retained placenta itself, poor calving hygiene, difficult or abnormal calvings, overfat cows and calves born dead.

Equally important risk factors for endometritis are hypocalcemia, RFM, high triacylglycerol and NEFA, therefore, ensuring correct nutritional management both pre and post-calving is important (Roche, 2006). Ensure cows are not over fat at the time of calving and that excessive weight isn’t lost in the pre or post-calving period (Blowey, 1999).

Vitamin E or prostaglandin injections could be used on a short-term basis as part of a concentrated effort to improve the situation in the herd, once all other management changes have been exhausted. The use of some homeopathic remedies such as series of varied treatments with Lachesis compositum (Lachesis), Carduus compositum (Carduus), and Traumeel LT (Traumeel) as prophylaxis to prevent of endometritis has shown to be ineffective (Arlt et al., 2009).

101,"Metritis, simply put, is inflammation of the uterus. Acute puerperal metritis is relatively uncommon and is defined as acute inflammatory changes in the endometrium, myometrium and peritoneal (outer) layers of the uterus within 10 days of calving (Sheldon et al., 2006). It is either due to an excessive bacterial challenge (often associated with RFM, infectious abortion, dystocia which required assistance or dirty calving equipment) or due to a reduced ability of the cow’s defense mechanism to clear infection (concurrent disease such as milk fever or dystocia) (Bruun et al., 2002; Fleischer et al., 2001; Sheldon et al., 2006). Should the bacteria load become too great, toxins produced can lead to toxemia, septicemia  and shock, with the condition rapidly progressing in severity.  This can be fatal unless cows are rapidly and intensively treated by a veterinary surgeon.

Cows with metritis will appear dull, may be pyrexic or have a sub-normal temperature, anorexic and dehydrated and may have a foul-smelling vaginal discharge.","Including retained placenta itself, poor calving hygiene, difficult or abnormal calvings, overfat cows and calves born dead. Excessive weight loss after calving (negative energy balance) has also been associated with dirty cows, and indeed, the risk factors for endometritis are hypocalcemia, RFM, high triacylglycerol and NEFA (Roche, 2006).","Includes the following conditions: Metritis, Endometritis, Pyometra.     Post-partum problems are often inter-linked and can be the result of nutritional, breeding, management and environmental factors acting to compromise the cow’s ability to withstand disease. Retained fetal membranes (RFM) are often associated with subsequent uterine infections, although infections can readily occur in the absence of RFM. Microbial contamination of the reproductive tract at and just after parturition can be considered to be a normal feature, with infection eliminated by the cow’s own immune defense mechanisms and not causing a severe problem (Sheldon et al., 2006). However, in some cases, infection overwhelms the cow’s ability to respond and a number of conditions may occur. Post-partum conditions can cause low conception rates both in the first-lactation and in older cows and negatively impacts on the proportion of pregnant cows at 300 days (Toni et al., 2015).","Treating Metritis
Cows with acute metritis should be seen by a veterinary surgeon. They require treatment with antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS) to counter pain, inflammation and bacterial endotoxins and fluid therapy (either oral or intra-venous).  Cows should be nursed carefully in a well bedded box with special care taken that she does not develop mastitis. The prognosis for cows with metritis must be guarded. Systemic treatment with antimicrobials has been reported to be as effective as combined systemic and local antimicrobial therapy in these cases (Drillich et al., 2001). Recently ampicillin has been shown to be as effective as ceftiofur in treating metritis, reducing the need for critically important antibiotics (Lima et al., 2014).","The control of post-partum infection focuses on the main causes of the condition. Controlling the incidence of retained placenta will have a direct effect on the levels of endometritis. Improved hygiene in calving boxes and calving assistance are also likely to reduce the occurrence of endometritis- especially in herds where hygiene has been poor.

102,"The most common form of uterine inflammation is a chronic form that is often called endometritis (also known as “whites” or “dirty cows”). Endometritis is defined as inflammation of the endometrium only and is seen from 3 weeks after calving and up to three months of lactation when various levels of uterine discharge can be observed, particularly when the cow is in heat and the uterine cervix opens up. While the affected cows are seldom severely ill as a result of endometritis, the condition is considered important as it results in poor conception rates and prolongs the inter-calving intervals. The incidence of endometritis varies, but in a recent study, sub-clinical endometritis was found in 26% of cattle in a herd (Carneiro et al., 2014), although it can vary with season with highest incidence in winter (Sheldon et al., 2004).","The causes of endometritis are similar to those that increase the incidence of retained placenta in a herd, including retained placenta itself, poor calving hygiene, difficult or abnormal calvings, overfat cows and calves born dead. Excessive weight loss after calving (negative energy balance) has also been associated with dirty cows, and indeed, the risk factors for endometritis are hypocalcemia, RFM, high triacylglycerol and NEFA (Roche, 2006).","Includes the following conditions: Metritis, Endometritis, Pyometra.

It has been shown that early treatment of endometritis leads to better conception rates and shorter calving intervals in herds that suffer from the condition. Treatment success rates are higher for mild cases compared to more severe cases and those with a foul-smelling odor (Sheldon et al., 2004). Intra-uterine pessaries (either antibiotic or herbal) are a common treatment for the condition. If intra-uterine antimicrobials are to be used it should be considered that at less than 30 days post-partum, penicillin may be rendered ineffective due to the presence of bacteria which produce penicillinase (Sheldon et al., 2004). Both oxytetracycline and cephalosporins are broad spectrum antibiotics and effective in the uterine environment and should be considered as the drugs of choice (Sheldon et al., 2004). Use of cephapirin in cows with endometritis 3-6 weeks before breeding has been shown to improve fertility (McDougall, 2001). Alternatively, uterine infusions with 2% povidone iodine have shown to be an effective non-antibiotic alternative (Mido et al., 2015).","The control of post-partum infection focuses on the main causes of the condition.

103,"Pyometra is defined as an accumulation of pus in the uterus and by the persistence of a functional corpus luteum (Sheldon et al., 2004). Pyometra is often due to chronic endometritis with the normal cycling of the cow disrupted by the presence of infection in the uterus. Affected cows do not appear ill but may be presented as not seen in heat. There will be an obviously enlarged, doughy uterus, which may potentially be mistaken as a pregnancy but if ultrasound scanned will show a content of pus rather than fetus and fetal fluids.","The causes of endometritis are similar to those that increase the incidence of retained placenta in a herd, including retained placenta itself, poor calving hygiene, difficult or abnormal calvings, overfat cows and calves born dead.

104,"Also known as: Muscular Dystrophy, Myopathy, Nutritional Myodegeneration, White Muscle Disease.   Selenium and Vitamin E have complementary but independent roles as antioxidants and are essential elements for animals. A number of antioxidants and trace minerals have important roles in immune function and may affect health in transition dairy cow (Spears and Weiss, 2008) as well as muscle growth and function in calves. The requirements depend on age, physiological stage and species (Villar et al., 2002).  Vitamin E is synthesized by plants but not by animals. ","Grass normally contains adequate levels of vitamin E, but lush spring grass may contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).  When eaten by the animal, these PUFAs are highly susceptible to oxidation.  Forage crops such as rape or kale are a good source of vitamin E, as is grass silage.  Root crops are poor sources and many hays may also be low in vitamin E.  The maturity and storage of feed materials affect their vitamin E content.  Cereals contain moderate levels of vitamin E, but the use of propionic acid or caustic soda to preserve moist grain rapidly destroys the vitamin.
","1, For Calves:   Subacute muscular dystrophy, also known as white muscle disease, is the most commonly seen form of selenium deficiency in calves. Between 10% to 40% of animals die of this condition (Andrews A. H., 1992). The signs depend on the muscles affected. The calf may stand and move stiffly. It is weak and reluctant to move. However, the calf is fully conscious and has a normal appetite, temperature and respiratory rate, though the heart rate may be raised. In some cases, the affected muscles are swollen and firm on palpation (Andrews and Blowey, 1992; Suttle et al., 1992).      2, For Adult Cattles;   Clinical signs of low selenium/vitamin E status in adult cows are more difficult to determine.

Growing calves should receive a supplement at a rate of 0.1 p.p.m. selenium of the total ration and 150 mg/head/day of a-tocopherol to ensure adequate status of both nutrients (Andrews et al., 1995).","Establish whether the soil and farm grown forages are deficient in selenium
Establish whether selenium/vitamin E deficiency may be a reason why stock are not doing well (consider blood sampling or post mortem examination where appropriate)
Use plants in the sward (e.g. legumes) containing a higher level of minerals, including selenium
Combine feedstuffs low in vitamin E (e.g. root crops or hay) with high ones (e.g. grass silage or forage crops)
Do not use any preservatives which destroy vitamin E (e.g. sulfuric acid in grass silage)
Use slower growing breeds of cattle
Control and prevent selenium/vitamin E deficiency where there is proven to be a farm deficiency problem in calves by giving pregnant cows a selenium/vitamin E containing bolus or injection
If necessary, prevent chronic selenium/vitamin E deficiency causing poor growth rates in older ruminating calves (above 78 kg body weight) with a selenium/vitamin E bolus.
Use injectable vitamin E/selenium preparations to treat calves with subacute muscle dystrophy
Do not over-supplement with selenium, to prevent risks of selenium poisoning
On severely selenium/vitamin E deficient farms, a strategy should be worked out with the veterinarian to control and prevent deficiency in cattle as part of the health plan. (For example, using management strategies, combining feedstuffs low and high in vitamin E, strategic use of boluses, in-feed minerals, mineral licks)
Measures should be taken to improve the situation in the long term and to reduce dependency on conventional treatments. For example, the composition of the sward could be changed in such a way that the mineral status is improved (e.g. inclusion of legumes) and slower growing breeds of cattle could be used",white muscle disease,107
108,"Also known as: Muscular Dystrophy, Myopathy, Nutritional Myodegeneration, White Muscle Disease.   Selenium and Vitamin E have complementary but independent roles as antioxidants and are essential elements for animals. A number of antioxidants and trace minerals have important roles in immune function and may affect health in transition dairy cow (Spears and Weiss, 2008) as well as muscle growth and function in calves. The requirements depend on age, physiological stage and species (Villar et al., 2006).  Vitamin E is synthesized by plants but not by animals.","Grass normally contains adequate levels of vitamin E, but lush spring grass may contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).  When eaten by the animal, these PUFAs are highly susceptible to oxidation.  Forage crops such as rape or kale are a good source of vitamin E, as is grass silage.  Root crops are poor sources and many hays may also be low in vitamin E.  The maturity and storage of feed materials affect their vitamin E content.  Cereals contain moderate levels of vitamin E, but the use of propionic acid or caustic soda to preserve moist grain rapidly destroys the vitamin.
","1, For Calves:   Subacute muscular dystrophy, also known as white muscle disease, is the most commonly seen form of selenium deficiency in calves. Between 10% to 40% of animals die of this condition (Andrews A. H., 1992). The signs depend on the muscles affected. The calf may stand and move stiffly. It is weak and reluctant to move. However, the calf is fully conscious and has a normal appetite, temperature and respiratory rate, though the heart rate may be raised. In some cases, the affected muscles are swollen and firm on palpation (Andrews and Blowey, 1992; Suttle et al., 1992).      2, For Adult Cattles;   Clinical signs of low selenium/vitamin E status in adult cows are more difficult to determine.  However, adult cows with a selenium/vitamin E deficiency may be more likely to retain the placenta, have an abnormal calving and are more susceptible to metritis and cystic ovaries (Erskine et al., 1997; Harrison et al., 1984; Kommisrud et al., 2005; LeBlanc et al., 2004; Mee, 2004). Selenium deficiency has also been linked with milk fever (Heilig et al., 2018).","Treating Selenium Deficiency
Calves with sudden death syndrome or acute muscular dystrophy are usually found dead. Commercial injectable vitamin E/selenium preparations to treat subacute muscle dystrophy are available. In severe cases, injections may have to be repeated weekly for several weeks, and in such cases the risks of toxicity with Selenium rich preparations should be considered.

Due to the toxicity of selenium, a veterinary surgeon is required to confirm a deficiency and advise before any treatments are administered. All selenium products require a veterinary prescription.","Supplements

However, they can appear normal but are more likely to abort later in life. Transmission of N. caninum is regarded as either vertical or horizontal. Horizontal transmission is from animal or group to another i.e., dog to dog, or dog to cow, or cow to dog (dog eating meat or placenta) and vertical transmission is from one generation to another i.e., dam to calf transplacentally.","Neospora caninum is a protozoan parasite primarily causing abortions and reproductive problems in cattle and disease in canids (mainly dogs, but also foxes, coyotes, dingoes and grey wolves).

Most abortions occur either sporadically on farms with annual abortion rates of less than 3% or as more frequent abortions on farms with annual abortion rates of 5 to 10 per cent (Haddad et al., 2005; Taylor, 2000). Occasionally, abortion storms may occur, where rates may reach 60% of cows at risk and may be associated with introduction of infection (horizontal transmission) or by recrudescence of infection in endemically infected herds (Haddad et al., 2005). It is possible for cattle that have previously aborted due to N. caninum infection to have a repeat abortion, with seropositive cows two to 24 times more likely to abort than seronegative cows.      2, Milk Production: Infection is thought to reduce milk production in adult dairy cows through its effects on fertility as cows which have aborted often produce a lower milk yield and are more likely to suffer retained fetal membranes (Hobson et al., 2002). ","There is no effective treatment for this condition, although aborting cows should be given symptomatic supportive treatment and isolated until a diagnosis is made or veterinary advice given if no diagnosis is reached.

However, dogs can be treated for N. caninum if diagnosed early but you need to consult your vet.","With uninfected herds, strict biosecurity should be maintained to prevent disease entry. This should form part of the biosecurity component of the Herd Health Plan. Bought in female breeding animals should come from herds known to be free or tested before they calve for the first time. Additionally, risk factors for horizontal transmission should be minimized, so that access to feed and water areas by dogs should be prohibited. A monitoring program should also be undertaken to examine all abortions (including maternal serology) to monitor herd disease status.","Investigate all cases of abortion in order to identify causes (See Abortion) – In the UK it is statutory to report  all abortions to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)
If N. caninum is detected on the farm as a result of an abortion investigation, monitor all calves that are born for seropositivity and try to keep seronegative calves as replacements
Consider culling infected animals. Do not rear seropositive offspring and/or offspring of infected dams for breeding
Prevent cows’ access to dogs
Prevent dogs from soiling pastures, animal feed and water supplies
Prevent dogs’ access to potentially contaminated material, i.e. afterbirth, aborted materials

Longer term effects of RFM are an increase in time to first service, lower first service conception rate and thus an increase in time to conception (Fourichon et al., 2000; McDougall, 2001).  Cows that abort, calve prematurely, have twins, have a difficult calving or any other debilitating illness during calving are more likely to cleanse poorly than full term, uncomplicated calvings.

Cows that abort, calve prematurely, have twins, have a difficult calving or any other debilitating illness during calving are more likely to cleanse poorly than full term, uncomplicated calvings. Unhygienic calving conditions are an obvious risk for both retained placenta and metritis.","A veterinary surgeon should preferably be called to any cow with RFM that shows clinical signs of fever, depression or reduction in milk yield as these cases may have secondary problems or require antimicrobial therapy. If the cow shows no signs of ill health, treatment can be left until four to five days after calving.

Many commonly used treatments have no proven efficacy. In a review on the subject manual, removal has been shown to be detrimental on subsequent fertility and intra-uterine antibiotics have been ineffective. Systemic antibiotics are only indicated if the cow has a fever, they have not shown to prevent metritis when used routinely in cows with uncomplicated retained fetal membranes. Prostaglandins and oxytocin were both ineffective in treating the condition (Beagley et al. 2012).","The control of retained placenta needs to focus on the control of causative factors like abortions, premature calving, calving difficulties, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Milk fever, even in its sub-clinical form needs to be controlled. Milk fever and even sub-clinical calcium deficiency can be associated with an increased risk of RFM (Zhang et al., 2002; Melendez et al., 2004) with older cows more at risk of lower blood calcium. Good control of feeding and condition during the dry period and avoiding cows becoming overfat, will also reduce the incidence of retained afterbirth.   In recent literature reviews, both Selenium deficiency and reduced serum concentrations of Ca, Mg, Mo and Zn were all associated with a high incidence of RFM (Allison and Laven, 2000, Bourne et al., 2007, Bicalho et al., 2016).  In both instances, supplementation with the respective deficient mineral can help reduce retention.","All of the following points should be included in the farm’s herd health plan:

Record carefully all the calvings resulting to retained placenta, noting details about the cow’s other symptoms or problems
Assess the situation after each calving season and decide whether there is a need for improvement (less than 10% of the calvings should result in retained placenta)
Avoid over-fat cows at calving (condition score 2.5-5 at drying off and at calving)
Control milk fever. If older cows have a history of previous milk fever, consider giving supplementary calcium at calving to avoid sub-clinical hypocalcemia or adjust the feeding pre-calving
Avoid vitamin E/selenium deficiency in your herd
Maintain good calving box and calving assistance hygiene",rfm,117
118,"Salmonellosis is a bacterial, zoonotic disease of humans and animals. The condition has different manifestations in infected animals. An acute generalized infection is seldom seen, but causes a severe condition that can be fatal without effective treatment in vulnerable individuals. An acute intestinal infection causes diarrhea, particularly in young animals. Calves with Salmonellosis may become septicemic and die, or may suffer from necrosis of extremities as a sequel, especially the feet, tail and ear tips.  Other manifestations can be joint ill or pneumonia. A chronic intestinal infection can be asymptomatic clinically, and often leads to the presence of carrier animals that are not identified as Salmonella infected. Several serovars have been associated with abortions, with Salmonellosis being the third most commonly diagnosed infectious cause of abortion in the UK (approximately 10% of diagnosed abortions). Within a herd the spread is often rapid among the calves. Cattle movement, especially calf trade, also spreads the infection between farms.","The majority of Salmonella isolations in the UK are associated with clinical disease as there is no routine surveillance for Salmonella. However, it has been found in other countries that many dairy farms may harbor Salmonella, either in the environment (up to 93% of herds tested) or as sub-clinical cases where shedding is from the cows themselves (10% of cows), thus, the farm environment should be viewed as an important potential reservoir of infection (Blau et al., 2005; Callaway et al., 2005; Fossler et al., 2005a; Peek et al., 2004). A study of organic and conventional dairy herds in the US found no difference in Salmonella prevalence between farm types (Fossler et al., 2005a).","The condition has different manifestations in infected animals. An acute generalized infection is seldom seen, but causes a severe condition that can be fatal without effective treatment in vulnerable individuals. An acute intestinal infection causes diarrhea, particularly in young animals. Calves with Salmonellosis may become septicemic and die, or may suffer from necrosis of extremities as a sequel, especially the feet, tail and ear tips.  Other manifestations can be joint ill or pneumonia. A chronic intestinal infection can be asymptomatic clinically, and often leads to the presence of carrier animals that are not identified as Salmonella infected. Several serovars have been associated with abortions.","The treatment of Salmonella infection in cattle with antibiotics in acute cases is common and may reduce mortalities if initiated early and combined with support therapy. Animals which have received antimicrobial therapy have been reported to be less likely to shed Salmonellae, so this may help reduce cross infection in the cohort (Fecteau et al., 2003; Fossler et al., 2005d). In contradiction to this, Warnick et al., (2003) found a higher risk of shedding in heifers and cows but not calves which have recently received antimicrobial treatment.  The use of antibiotics metaphylactically in the face of an outbreak is not recommended, due to the high risk of antimicrobial resistance development. Prophylactic antibiotic administration in feed does not appear to have any effect on excretion of Salmonellae in calves either (Wray et al., 1987b). In an outbreak, appropriate support therapy for severely affected animals and vaccination can be helpful. Rehydration therapy and Salmonella antiserum (where available) have been found helpful in preventing high mortalities.","The following risk factors within the farmer’s influence relevant to salmonellosis control on a farm were identified by (Evans, 1996):

Purchasing replacement stock from direct sources rather than from dealers
Quarantine of purchased cattle for 4 weeks before inclusion in the main herd
Housing sick animals in isolated areas
Preventing wild bird access to feed stores","In the case of a Salmonella-free herd:

Stick to a closed herd policy
Diagnose all cases of diarrhea or abortion by sampling and submitting to laboratory analysis
If animals need to be bought in, avoid dealer’s yards and cattle markets: buy directly from the farm of origin and find out the disease status beforehand
If the disease status of the farm of origin is not clear, quarantine bought-in animals for 4 weeks before including in the main herd
Avoid bringing in contamination from other farms (i.e. on borrowed machinery)
Make sure that the feed storage is secure and there is no access for wildlife or domestic pets.
Communicate with your neighbors!
In the case of a herd with an ongoing Salmonella infection:

At the start of an outbreak, consider vaccinating animals, as this has been shown to offer some protection.
Employ strict hygiene practices and isolate sick animals
Consider a whole herd test program with culling of persistently positive animals
Do not sell animals from the farm – other than direct to slaughter – until the farm is cleared, unless you tell the buyer about the ongoing salmonellosis on the farm
Communicate with your neighbors!",salmonellosis,118
