feed,"For the first three days of its life, a calf should receive two equal feedings of colostrum and transition milk daily. After that, feed pasteurized whole milk, fresh or fermented colostrum, waste milk, or milk replacer twice a day. Feed at a rate of 12 percent of initial body weight from birth to weaning. Within several days of birth, offer the calf fresh water and small amounts of grain. When weaning occurs at 4 to 6 weeks of age, the calf should be consuming at least 1.5-2.0 pounds of grain per day. Following weaning, and once the calf is consuming 5 to 6 pounds of grain daily, it can have hay or other forage on a free-choice basis. Regardless of the type of forage fed, all ages of heifers should receive a grain mixture. The amount fed will depend partly on the calf's age, but primarily on the quality of the forage. After the calves are 9 months old, they can be put on pasture supplemented with small amounts of grain and forages. Feed additives such as ionophores (monesin and lasalocid) can be used to help improve the heifers' dietary energy efficiency. Feeding ionophores will enhance heifer growth and increase their feed utilization. Fresh water must be continually available at all stages of the dairy heifer's life.

colostrum,"Milking the cow within 1-2 hours after calving then feeding the calf the correct amount (4 quarts) of high-quality colostrum immediately (at 1-2 hours of age) are the recommended best management practices for optimal calf nutrition, health, and survival.  Colostrum (the milk produced from the mammary gland in the first 24 hours after birth) contains immunoglobulins that, when absorbed by the calf’s gut, help protect the calf from common disease challenges. The passing of this protection from dam to calf is called passive transfer. Research has clearly shown that calves with adequate passive transfer grow better, have lower mortality and health cost, and as adults have improved first and second lactation milk production, when compared to calves with failure of passive transfer.  Producers should pay close attention to this critical phase of a calf’s life through exemplary colostrum management."

vaccination,"It is recommend to vaccinate heifers at 4 to 8 months of age and before breeding. The vaccination program for replacement heifers should provide optimal protection from reproductive diseases and should include vaccination for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) types 1 and 2. Depending on the local disease risk, vaccinations for Brucella, Leptospira, Trichomonas, and Campylobacter may also be indicated. Brucella vaccination is performed according to state or regional regulations. Modified-live vaccines for IBR and BVD give the broadest immunity to strain differences and should be given twice to ensure a high level of immunity. Some evidence suggests that modified-live BVD and IBR vaccines may transiently infect the ovary and cause decreased fertility. For this reason, vaccination should be done ≥1 mo before breeding. Vaccination of heifers with Trichomonas vaccine increases calving rate and decreases duration of infection in infected herds but does not prevent infection. A vaccine for trichomoniasis may be useful in infected herds or in herds at high risk of infection, but it may not be economic in low-risk herds."

Depending on the local disease risk, vaccinations for Brucella, Leptospira, Trichomonas, and Campylobacter may also be indicated. Brucella vaccination is performed according to state or regional regulations. Modified-live vaccines for IBR and BVD give the broadest immunity to strain differences and should be given twice to ensure a high level of immunity. Some evidence suggests that modified-live BVD and IBR vaccines may transiently infect the ovary and cause decreased fertility. For this reason, vaccination should be done ≥4 mo before breeding. Vaccination of heifers with Trichomonas vaccine increases calving rate and decreases duration of infection in infected herds but does not prevent infection. A vaccine for trichomoniasis may be useful in infected herds or in herds at high risk of infection, but it may not be economic in low-risk herds."
parasites,Parasites are a major potential health problem. A routine deworming program for young calves should start at weaning and continue until 8 months of age. Heifers should be dewormed 3 and 6 weeks after they are put on pasture and in the fall after confinement.

diarrhea,"Coccidiosis can cause diarrhea in calves beginning at 3 weeks of age. Incorporating a prevention product, such as coccidiostat or ionophore, can help control coccidiosis. Calves also should be treated for external parasites such as flies, mange mites, and lice."
dysentery,"Coccidiosis can cause diarrhea in calves beginning at 4 weeks of age. Incorporating a prevention product, such as coccidiostat or ionophore, can help control coccidiosis. Calves also should be treated for external parasites such as flies, mange mites, and lice."
BVDV,"Coccidiosis can cause diarrhea in calves beginning at 5 weeks of age. Incorporating a prevention product, such as coccidiostat or ionophore, can help control coccidiosis. Calves also should be treated for external parasites such as flies, mange mites, and lice."
lax,"Coccidiosis can cause diarrhea in calves beginning at 6 weeks of age. Incorporating a prevention product, such as coccidiostat or ionophore, can help control coccidiosis. Calves also should be treated for external parasites such as flies, mange mites, and lice."
biosecurity,"Biosecurity is a set of production management practices that reduce or prevent the introduction of diseases onto a farm. Every person who is involved with the farm (production management, labor, service providers, and especially breeder and veterinarian services) has a role in minimizing the introduction of disease into a herd. Before animals are brought to the farm, be sure to: Check the history of the herd's health to determine if calves are coming from a reputable source. Implement a reasonable animal-testing program on all heifers that enter your herd. Quarantine and observe any new animals introduced to the farm for 2 to 4 weeks to minimize the spread of the following health concerns: bovine viral disease, salmonella, foot rot, Johne's disease, and hairy warts."

Group1,"Group 1 (calves under two months of age) Special provisions should be made to get baby calves off to a good start. To minimize disease transmission, they should be separated from older animals in dry and draft-free living quarters, designed to facilitate easy feeding and regular observation. General requirements for calves under two months on predominately liquid diets are: 1, individual hou.sing for each calf; 2, isolation from older animals; 3, well-ventilatd but draft-free quarters; 4, dry pens with ample bedding;"
Group2,"Group 2 (calves two to four months old) This period in a calfs life is also critical for good growth. A small group housing facility for three to five calves should be provided for a postweaning period of at last one month. The housing and environmental conditions should be similar to the baby calf facility and preferably be located in the same area to minimize stress on the calf caused by changes in living· arrangements. Placement with the zero to two months-old calves allows for regular feeding and observation of the two groups. Such an arrangement also minimizes calf stress at this early age. Housing for this age group can include large group hutches, sometimes called super hutches, located adjacent to the calf hutch area, or an open front shed. Buildings with individual pens for baby calves should also have a group pen at least 12 feet by 12 feet to house three to five postweaning calves. Whether group hutch or inside pen, the weaning area should provide: continuously available frostproof water; at least 18 inches of bunk space for each calf with stanchions or dividers to define individual eating areas;"
Group3-7,"Group 3 through 7 (heifers five months old to calving) Once the calf is well adjusted to group living and is eating from community feed bunks and waterers, there are a variety of choices available for housing. The main requirements for these age groups are dictated by the increased space needed as the animal gets older, changes in rations, herd health, breeding, and observation. The degree of shelter required decreases with age. A housing facility for heifers from five months to freshening must provide: grouping by age and size for each group; ease of movement of animals from one group to another; ease of observation; feeding by age groups as necessary; restraint facilities for treatment and breeding; convenient manure removal and bedding as necessary; continually available frostproof water; good natural ventilation."
