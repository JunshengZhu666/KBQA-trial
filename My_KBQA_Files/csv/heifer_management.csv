1,breeding,"Heifers should be ready to breed at 13 to 15 months so they are able to calve around 24 months. The keys to a successful breeding program are proper nutrition, a preventive health program, routine heat detection, and timely insemination. Keeping accurate heat date and breeding records is an important aspect of a heifer-breeding program. ------------------------------------------------------------ You can further ask for: conception rate, estrus and growth monitoring. "
2,feeding,"For the first three days of its life, a calf should receive two equal feedings of colostrum and transition milk daily. After that, feed pasteurized whole milk, fresh or fermented colostrum, waste milk, or milk replacer twice a day. Feed at a rate of 12 percent of initial body weight from birth to weaning. Within several days of birth, offer the calf fresh water and small amounts of grain. When weaning occurs at 4 to 6 weeks of age, the calf should be consuming at least 1.5-2.0 pounds of grain per day. Following weaning, and once the calf is consuming 5 to 6 pounds of grain daily, it can have hay or other forage on a free-choice basis. Regardless of the type of forage fed, all ages of heifers should receive a grain mixture. The amount fed will depend partly on the calf's age, but primarily on the quality of the forage. After the calves are 9 months old, they can be put on pasture supplemented with small amounts of grain and forages. Feed additives such as ionophores (monesin and lasalocid) can be used to help improve the heifers' dietary energy efficiency. Feeding ionophores will enhance heifer growth and increase their feed utilization. Fresh water must be continually available at all stages of the dairy heifer's life.  You can further ask for colostrum, feed additives, nutritional requirements  ------------------------------------------------------------ You can further ask about colostrum, feed additives and nutritional requirements."
3,health,"The first few months of a calf's life are critical for producing a healthy animal. Digestive and respiratory diseases that occur in young calves often result from overcrowding, poor ventilation, improper nutrition, inadequate sanitation, and cold, wet weather. Therefore, the best kind of health program is a preventive one and starts with a good housing and feeding program. ------------------------------------------------------------ You can further ask for heifer vaccination, parasites, diarrhea and biosecurity."
4,housing ,"Heifers should be kept in dry, well-ventilated, draft-free quarters that have sufficient bedding. Humidity and odor control are necessary for the heifer's health and comfort. In addition, you must have a handling facility for routine health examinations and breeding. Before weaning, keep calves in individual pens to isolate them from older animals. Several types of calf facilities are recommended, including individual calf hutches, pens with three solid or slatted walls and a slatted front opening for feeding, and calf hutches grouped together in a three-sided building. For the first month or two following weaning, house three to five calves in a large hutch or shed with an outside yard. Calves 4 to 11 months of age need 6 inches of bunk space (feeding area); calves 12 to 17 months need 12 inches of bunk space; and heifers over 18 months need 18 inches of bunk space to ensure adequate feed availability. When the calves are 4 months old, they should be moved to a grow-out facility. ------------------------------------------------------------ You can further ask for different age groupings: Group1, Group2, Group3-7."
