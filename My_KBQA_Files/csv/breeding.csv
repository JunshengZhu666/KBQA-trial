1,conception,"1, Have you supply replacement heifers with better quality forage ?  2, Have you bred them in a good timing? (They needed to be bred by 15 months of age when they reach 65% of their mature body weight)  Tips1, One possible opportunity to decrease the age in which puberty is reached is to utilize ionophores. Research has shown that by including ionophores in the diet of developing heifers, it will slightly decrease the age in which heifers reach puberty.  Tips2, To help insure that they do not conceive late in the breeding season or fail to breed, it may be a good idea to breed your yearling heifers 2 to 3 weeks before the cows to help compensate for the ""sophomores""  stress."
2,estrus,"1, The problem of estrus could be  from health, feeding, housing. 2, In terms of health, try consider ovarian hypoplasia, ovarian stagnation and atrophy, durable corpus luteum and Luteal cyst. 2, In terms of feeding. If forage quality is excellent and high in energy content, heifers can become fat and not meet the height requirement for their age. This can affect heifers becoming pregnant and also having calving difficulties. If forage quality is extremely high in protein content and energy limited, heifers may have the height but not enough body condition. If forage quality is poor and protein and energy are not properly supplemented, then heifers may not be at the correct weight or height when they reach breeding age."
3,monitoring,"Action plan for monitoring heifer growth Goal: Using a weigh tape, measure heifer weights at 4, 8, and 12 months of age on at least 50% of the animals in a particular age group. Measure the weight on all heifers on day of calving. Record the information in the Penn State Customized Dairy Heifer Growth Chart. Step 1: Purchase a heifer weight tape. Step 2: Every two months, measure 50% of the animals in a particular pen averaging in age of 4, 8, and 12 months. Step 3: Measure the weight on each heifer after calving. Step 4: Record information into a growth chart spreadsheet comparing the farm's heifer weights with expected. Step 5: Present the graph at profit team meetings to examine how well heifers are growing and if ration adjustments are needed."
