1,Group1,"Group 1 (calves under two months of age) Special provisions should be made to get baby calves off to a good start. To minimize disease transmission, they should be separated from older animals in dry and draft-free living quarters, designed to facilitate easy feeding and regular observation. General requirements for calves under two months on predominately liquid diets are: 1, individual hou.sing for each calf; 2, isolation from older animals; 3, well-ventilatd but draft-free quarters; 4, dry pens with ample bedding;"
2,Group2,"Group 2 (calves two to four months old) This period in a calfs life is also critical for good growth. A small group housing facility for three to five calves should be provided for a postweaning period of at last one month. The housing and environmental conditions should be similar to the baby calf facility and preferably be located in the same area to minimize stress on the calf caused by changes in living· arrangements. Placement with the zero to two months-old calves allows for regular feeding and observation of the two groups. Such an arrangement also minimizes calf stress at this early age. Housing for this age group can include large group hutches, sometimes called super hutches, located adjacent to the calf hutch area, or an open front shed. Buildings with individual pens for baby calves should also have a group pen at least 12 feet by 12 feet to house three to five postweaning calves. Whether group hutch or inside pen, the weaning area should provide: continuously available frostproof water; at least 18 inches of bunk space for each calf with stanchions or dividers to define individual eating areas;"
3,Group3-7,"Group 3 through 7 (heifers five months old to calving) Once the calf is well adjusted to group living and is eating from community feed bunks and waterers, there are a variety of choices available for housing. The main requirements for these age groups are dictated by the increased space needed as the animal gets older, changes in rations, herd health, breeding, and observation. The degree of shelter required decreases with age. A housing facility for heifers from five months to freshening must provide: grouping by age and size for each group; ease of movement of animals from one group to another; ease of observation; feeding by age groups as necessary; restraint facilities for treatment and breeding; convenient manure removal and bedding as necessary; continually available frostproof water; good natural ventilation."
