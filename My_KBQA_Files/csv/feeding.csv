1,colostrum,"Milking the cow within 1-2 hours after calving then feeding the calf the correct amount (4 quarts) of high-quality colostrum immediately (at 1-2 hours of age) are the recommended best management practices for optimal calf nutrition, health, and survival.  Colostrum (the milk produced from the mammary gland in the first 24 hours after birth) contains immunoglobulins that, when absorbed by the calf’s gut, help protect the calf from common disease challenges. The passing of this protection from dam to calf is called passive transfer. Research has clearly shown that calves with adequate passive transfer grow better, have lower mortality and health cost, and as adults have improved first and second lactation milk production, when compared to calves with failure of passive transfer.  Producers should pay close attention to this critical phase of a calf’s life through exemplary colostrum management."
