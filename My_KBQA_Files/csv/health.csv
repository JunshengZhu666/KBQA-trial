1,vaccination,"It is recommend to vaccinate heifers at 4 to 8 months of age and before breeding. The vaccination program for replacement heifers should provide optimal protection from reproductive diseases and should include vaccination for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) types 1 and 2. Depending on the local disease risk, vaccinations for Brucella, Leptospira, Trichomonas, and Campylobacter may also be indicated. Brucella vaccination is performed according to state or regional regulations. Modified-live vaccines for IBR and BVD give the broadest immunity to strain differences and should be given twice to ensure a high level of immunity. Some evidence suggests that modified-live BVD and IBR vaccines may transiently infect the ovary and cause decreased fertility. For this reason, vaccination should be done ≥1 mo before breeding. Vaccination of heifers with Trichomonas vaccine increases calving rate and decreases duration of infection in infected herds but does not prevent infection. A vaccine for trichomoniasis may be useful in infected herds or in herds at high risk of infection, but it may not be economic in low-risk herds."
2,parasites,Parasites are a major potential health problem. A routine deworming program for young calves should start at weaning and continue until 8 months of age. Heifers should be dewormed 3 and 6 weeks after they are put on pasture and in the fall after confinement. 
3,diarrhea,"Coccidiosis can cause diarrhea in calves beginning at 3 weeks of age. Incorporating a prevention product, such as coccidiostat or ionophore, can help control coccidiosis. Calves also should be treated for external parasites such as flies, mange mites, and lice."
4,biosecurity,"Biosecurity is a set of production management practices that reduce or prevent the introduction of diseases onto a farm. Every person who is involved with the farm (production management, labor, service providers, and especially breeder and veterinarian services) has a role in minimizing the introduction of disease into a herd. Before animals are brought to the farm, be sure to: Check the history of the herd's health to determine if calves are coming from a reputable source. Implement a reasonable animal-testing program on all heifers that enter your herd. Quarantine and observe any new animals introduced to the farm for 2 to 4 weeks to minimize the spread of the following health concerns: bovine viral disease, salmonella, foot rot, Johne's disease, and hairy warts."
